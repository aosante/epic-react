/* 
    This one's a bit tricky, and I'm going to be intentionally vague here to give
    you a bit of a challenge, but consider the scenario where we fetch a pokemon,
    and before the request finishes, we change our mind and navigate to a different
    page (or uncheck the mount checkbox). In that case, the component would get
    removed from the page ("unmounted") and when the request finally does complete,
    it will call `dispatch`, but because the component has been removed from the
    page, we'll get a warning from react.
  */

/*
    The best solution for this problem would be to cancel the request
    but even then, we'd have to handle the error and prevent the `dispatch` from
    being called for the rejected promise. This is the problem that this next custoom hook solves for us.
